# learning-git-and-github

This repository seeks to apply learnings taken from the LinkedIn class "Learning Git and GitHub". I will be practicing basic Git functions, such as cloning repositories, staging changes and commiting those changes. I will also be learning how to do things such as pushing to GitHub, and creating pull requests. I set up my repository to mimic the foundations of a website. Obviously it doesn't include everything needed, because I haven't learnt what goes in to coding a website yet.

In this project I had to add 2 extra files to the repository that served a purpose. I remembered building a basic website at school and adding an index.html file in our code. I did some research, and it seems the index.html file is key as it serves as the home page in a website, so I added that in. The other file I added was a .txt file with a link to this repository. 

In order to learn the fundementals of branching, I created a new branch called "readme". I then updated the README file to include more information. I then switched back to the main branch and merged the changes made.

Completing these activities have allowed me to gain confidence in using Git and GitHub.


.gitignore purpose:

    The .gitignore file allows us to hide certain parts of our code that we don't want or need other people to see. Things included in the .gitignore file are ignored when we         push our code to GitHub. Passwords + sensitive info along with system files are examples of things we may want to hide.
