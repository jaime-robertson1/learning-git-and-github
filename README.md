# learning-git-and-github
This repository seeks to apply learnings taken from the LinkedIn class "Learning Git and GitHub". I will be practicing basic Git functions, such as cloning repositories, staging changes and commiting those changes. I will also be learning how to do things such as pushing to GitHub, and creating pull requests.

.gitignore purpose:

    The .gitignore file allows us to hide certain parts of our code that we don't want or need other people to see. Things included in the .gitignore file are ignored when we push our code to GitHub. Passwords + sensitive info along with system files are examples of things we may want to hide.
